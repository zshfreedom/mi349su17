  <p>For this assignment I choose DJI website. The first principle I choose is Affordance, which is the physical characteristics influence function.
  DJI's main page have easy-access menu buttons on top which guide users easily go to the part of the site they need.
  Also the different photos also have hyperlinks within and can lead users to different stories. On the top right part is the store link, language changing button and the login function.
  Then for the mapping. DJI did a good job on the relationship between the controls and its well-design page. All function buttons are line up and easy to access. 
  Users can know what they need and go throung while the site have well-looking design. The chunking is also a principle I choose. On DJI's main page user don't see lots of words, but big pictures split the whole page apart.Each of them contain the topic they link to. Also they have a slidshow function for the featured part, which let they change over between the products every few seconds.
  Then users can simply click into them to see what they want. This is also related to the priciple of modularity. Every photo linked to a sub-page contain the detailed product informations, contact, etc.
  Overall, the page following the principle of the Ockham's razer. It's simple, easy-access and full of interactive activities.</p>
